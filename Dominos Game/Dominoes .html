        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>This is a simple Dominoes game for two players. The goal is to be the first to play all your tiles by matching them to the ends of the chain on the table.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> 28 domino tiles (0-0 to 6-6). Each player gets 10 tiles, 8 remain in the boneyard.</li>
            <li><strong>Starting:</strong> Random player starts by playing any tile.</li>
            <li><strong>Playing:</strong> Match one half of your tile to the head (left end) or tail (right end) of the chain. Click on a playable tile (highlighted in red) to play it. If both ends match, choose where to place.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> If no playable tile, click "Draw from Boneyard" to draw until you get a playable one or boneyard is empty (then pass).</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>If a player runs out of dominoes, they win the round and score points equal to the total pips in their opponent's hand.</li>
                    <li>If the game is blocked and no one can play, the player with the lowest total pips in their hand wins the round.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The first player to reach the agreed-upon target score (e.g., 100 or 150 points) over multiple rounds wins the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Vs Computer:</strong> You are Player 1, computer is Player 2. Computer plays automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>2 Players:</strong> Take turns on the same device. The current player's hand is visible, while the other player's hand is shown face-down to indicate remaining piece count.</li>
        </ul>
